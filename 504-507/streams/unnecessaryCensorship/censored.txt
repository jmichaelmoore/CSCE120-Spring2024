The *** glows white on the *** tonightNot a *** to be seenA kingdom of ***And it looks like I'm the ***The *** is howling like this swirling *** insideCouldn't *** it in, heaven ***s I triedDon't let them in, don't let them seeBe the good *** you always have to beConceal, don't feel, don't let them ***Well, now they ***Let it go, let it goCan't hold it *** anymoreLet it go, let it goTurn away and *** the doorI don't care what they're going to sayLet the *** rage onThe *** never bothered me anywayIt's funny how some *** makes everything seem smallAnd the *** that once controlled me can't get to me at allIt's time to see what I can doTo test the limits and *** throughNo right, no wrong, no rules for meI'm freeLet it go, let it goI am one with the *** and ***Let it go, let it goYou'll never see me ***Here I stand and here I stayLet the *** rage onMy *** flurries through the air into the groundMy *** is spiraling in *** fractals all aroundAnd one thought ***stallizes like an icy blastI'm never going ***, the past is in the pastLet it go, let it goAnd I'll *** like the *** of dawnLet it go, let it goThat perfect *** is goneHere I stand in the *** of dayLet the *** rage onThe *** never bothered me anyway
